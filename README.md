# Symbolic calculation for covariant transform on the SSR group

### [Vladimir V. Kisil](http://www1.maths.leeds.ac.uk/~kisilv/)

The SSR group stands for the semidirect product of the Heisenberg group and the ax+b group. We call it squeeze–shear–rotation (SSR) group by its action on the phase portrait of a Gaussian state. If  Gaussian is chosen as a vacuum state then the action of the Schrödinger –Jacobi group reduces to the action of the SSR group. We call the respective covariant transform (aka the coherent state transform) *metamorphism* for its transformation of partial differential equations [Ref.1](#refKisil21c). 

This is a working Jupyter notebook which were used for research published in [Ref.1](#refKisil21c). The notebook is very detailed with numerous cross-checks of the correctness and supplementary computation. It may serve also as a demonstration of [pyGiNaC](#http://moebinv.sourceforge.net/pyGiNaC.html) abilities for symbolic computations in actual research environment. 

**Note:** *to execute the notebook you may need to [install software](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vvkisil/MoebInv-notebooks/blob/master/Introduction/Software_installation_GUI_integration.ipynb).* Due to a recent "upgrade" of CoLab to Python 2.7 this notebook can not be used on that cloud service. If you do not have a local installation of  [pyGiNaC](#http://moebinv.sourceforge.net/pyGiNaC.html) then you can use a CodeOcean capsule [Ref.2](#refKisil21b).

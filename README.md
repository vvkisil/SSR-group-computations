# SSR-group-computations

This is a working Jupyter notebook which were used for research published in [Ref.1](#refKisil21c). The notebook is very detailed with numerous cross-checks of the correctness and supplementary computation. It may serve also as a demonstration of [pyGiNaC](#http://moebinv.sourceforge.net/pyGiNaC.html) abilities for symbolic computations in actual research environment. 

**Note:** *to execute the notebook you may need to [install software](https://colab.research.google.com/github/vvkisil/MoebInv-notebooks/blob/master/Introduction/Software_installation_GUI_integration.ipynb).* Due to a recent "upgrade" of CoLab to Python 2.7 this notebook can not be used on that cloud service. If you do not have a local installation of  [pyGiNaC](#http://moebinv.sourceforge.net/pyGiNaC.html) then you can use a CodeOcean capsule [Ref.2](#refKisil21b).
